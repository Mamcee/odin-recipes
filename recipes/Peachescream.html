    <h1>Grilled Peaches and Cream</h1>
    <p>
      This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream
      cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after
      they're grilled and they're perfect!

      <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
      <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>

    <p>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</p>

      Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the
      grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks.
      Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of
      the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3
      more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.
