    <h1>Shawarma</h1>
    <p>
      Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It’s a
      popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats
      that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as
      it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old
      pan or on the BBQ!

    <h2>Chicken Shawarma</h2>
    <p>
      Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though these
      days you see it with beef too. It’s commonly served in the form of a wrap,
      though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as
      seasoned rice or fries, and salads. In this recipe, I’m giving you both
      options!
