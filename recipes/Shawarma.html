    <h1>Shawarma</h1>
    <p>
      Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It’s a
      popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats
      that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as
      it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old
      pan or on the BBQ!
    </p>
    <h2>Chicken Shawarma</h2>
    <p>
      Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though these
      days you see it with beef too. It’s commonly served in the form of a wrap,
      though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as
      seasoned rice or fries, and salads. In this recipe, I’m giving you both
      options!

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>roasted Meat</strong> (Lamb,Chicken,Turkey, or Veal)</li>
      <li>
        <strong> Chicken </strong>-I like to make Shawarma with boneless,
        skinless thighs as its juicier than breast. But chicken breast and
        tenderloin both work great.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>olive oil</strong>-For a touch of flavour but also to dilute the
        lemon juice so it doesn’t “cook” the chicken (like we intentionally do
        with ceviche!).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pita wraps</strong>-this is the Shawarma wrapping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauces for Shawarma</h3>
    <p>
      While Tahini sauce or Yogurt sauce are the most common sauces used for
      Shawarma recipes, I will like to introduce you to a delectable easy to put
      together African Shawarma sauce (especially in Nigeria). We use a mixture
      of Ketchup and Mayonnaise. A hint of pepper is kind of a must in making
      this Shawarma sauce, so I used a little bit of Cayenne pepper. Red pepper
      flakes will work just as well. If you don’t want that extra little heat,
      then you can skip it.
