    <h1>Shawarma</h1>
    <p>
      Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East. It’s a
      popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced meats
      that are stacked on a vertical rotisserie with thin slices shaved off as
      it rotates. But don’t worry! We can cook our horizontally in a good old
      pan or on the BBQ!
    </p>
    <h2>Chicken Shawarma</h2>
    <p>
      Shawarma was traditionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though these
      days you see it with beef too. It’s commonly served in the form of a wrap,
      though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as
      seasoned rice or fries, and salads. In this recipe, I’m giving you both
      options!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>FOR THE SHAWARMA MARINADE</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>roasted Meat</strong> (Lamb,Chicken,Turkey, or Veal)</li>
      <li>
        <strong> Chicken </strong>-I like to make Shawarma with boneless,
        skinless thighs as its juicier than breast. But chicken breast and
        tenderloin both work great.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>olive oil</strong>-For a touch of flavour but also to dilute the
        lemon juice so it doesn’t “cook” the chicken (like we intentionally do
        with ceviche!).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Pita wraps</strong>-this is the Shawarma wrapping</li>
      <li><strong>Onion</strong>-Large red</li>
      <li><strong>Lemon Juice</strong>Table spoons</li>
      <li><strong>cloves garlic</strong>-minced</li>
      <li><strong>Tsp Ginger</strong>minced</li>
      <li><strong>Black pepper</strong>-tsp</li>
      <li><strong>nutmeg</strong>Tea spoon</li>
      <li><strong>Turmeric or curry powder</strong>-1/tsp</li>
      <li><strong>Thyme</strong>1/2 tsp</li>
      <li><strong>bouillon cube optional</strong>-1/2 tsp</li>
      <li><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong>-minced</li>

      <li>
        <strong> Olive Oil or any cooking oil of your choice</strong> 2
        Tablespoons
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>FOR THE SHAWARMA SAUCE</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Tablespoons Ketchup</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Cayenne pepper optional- A hint of</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sauces for Shawarma</h3>
    <p>
      While Tahini sauce or Yogurt sauce are the most common sauces used for
      Shawarma recipes, I will like to introduce you to a delectable easy to put
      together African Shawarma sauce (especially in Nigeria). We use a mixture
      of Ketchup and Mayonnaise. A hint of pepper is kind of a must in making
      this Shawarma sauce, so I used a little bit of Cayenne pepper. Red pepper
      flakes will work just as well. If you don’t want that extra little heat,
      then you can skip it.
    </p>
    <h4>FOR THE FILLING</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tomato ripe and hard</li>
      <li>1 Onion small red & sliced into strips</li>
      <li>1/4 lb Cucumber sliced into strips</li>
      <li>4 to 6 Lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>4 to 6 Tortilla Wraps large</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>NOTES FOR CHICKEN SHAWARMA RECIPE</h4>
    <p>
      You can replace Chicken with either Turkey, Beef, Veal, Lamb, Goat or a
      mixture of two or more of these meats. You can also skip Hot dog if you
      prefer. Some also like to add French fries to theirs. I used Tortilla
      wraps and Pita bread for this recipe, but other flatbreads such as Chapati
      or Roti will work well. Make sure to pat dry the chicken before adding the
      spices because excess water in the Chicken will water down the spices. I
      used boneless and skinless chicken thighs because it yields a nice taste
      and texture after cooking (my own opinion). You can skip the seasoning
      powder if you want to just replace it with about 1/4Tsp of salt or simply
      add salt to taste.
